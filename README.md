## SDK

Do you need to integrate a scanner into your mobile application? If so you should check out our client-side [SDK](https://moodstocks.com/documentation/getting-started/). It acts as a client for the API but also as an **offline cache**, allowing you to make **faster** scanners that work even with **no network connectivity**.
